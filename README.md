In this project, we will be using the LFW dataset from sklearn https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_lfw_people.html#sklearn.datasets.fetch_lfw_people
This dataset contains more than 13,000 face images of 5,749 people collected from the 
Here, I will be conduction deep learning on image classes that has at 70 images
I will also be testing the Lenet 5 Architecture on the dataset
The result of this project showed that Lenet 5 Architecture peformed poorly on this dataset
I modified the Lenet-5 Architecture, to fit into this project and I was able to achieve accuracy level of 87&
